This project uses a variation of the [OneFlow](https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow) branching model with two branches. Naming of long-lived branches is different:
* `develop` branch from OneFlow is called `master` in this repository.
* `master` branch from OneFlow is called `production` in this repository.
